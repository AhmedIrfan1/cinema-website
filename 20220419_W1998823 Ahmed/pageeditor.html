      <!-- Description -->
      <p>
        Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I made a splash screen for the main
        page. The website's logo and the student information are shown on the
        splash screen. After a few seconds, the student's information are shown.
        It immediately reroutes to the website's home page after a few seconds.

      <h2>Home page</h2>
      <p>
        I made a contribution to the home page by assisting in creating the
        links between the various HTML pages. I also integrated the store link
        into the navigation bar, giving users a simple way to reach the store.

      <h2>Store</h2>
      <p>
        To design a captivating, approachable, and responsive interface, I used
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I started by including a full-screen carousel
        to show the three main categories of things, along with a button to jump
        to each one individually. There were 3 goods in each category, and you
        could select the number you need and add them to your basket. Before the
        final checkout stage, I included a popup cart and many validation
        checks. When all necessary inputs have been successfully submitted, a
        modal window displaying the payment gateway opens. The cart is cleared
        and a success message displays if the payment form's all mandatory
        fields are filled in.

      <h2>Additional Content</h2>

      <p>
        I made a website with HTML and CSS,I included anchor tags to make it
        simple to navigate, allowing people to download the particular Anime
        movie

      <p>
        I hereby certify that the foregoing was entirely completed by myself,
        with assistance from the course notes, Stack Overflow, W3 Schools, and
        further learning from YouTube.
